# House Price Prediction – ML Pipeline

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict house prices.
It focuses on building a clean, reproducible, and extensible workflow covering data
preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Problem Statement

Accurate house price estimation is a critical problem in real estate and urban planning.
Traditional pricing approaches often fail to capture complex, non-linear relationships
between property attributes and market value. This project aims to address this problem
by designing a robust machine learning pipeline that learns these relationships from data
and produces reliable price predictions.
